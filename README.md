# ZeroGravitas' SWTOR Tools

This Blender Add-on provides with a miscellanea of tools to use on **Star Wars: The Old Republic**'s game assets. It will grow on features as new ones happen to occur to me ðŸ˜›. Quality of code isâ€¦ petrifying. Still, it works, kindasorta.

## Installation

The installation of the Add-on in Blender follows the usual directions:

1. [**Download the Add-on's "zg_swtors_tool.zip" file from here**](https://github.com/ZeroGravitasIndeed/zg_swtor_tools/raw/main/zg_swtor_tools.zip). Don't unZip it: it's used as such .zip.
2. In Blender, go to Edit menu > Preferences option > Add-ons tab > Installâ€¦ button.
3. Select the Add-on in the file dialog box and click on the Install Add-on button.
4. The Add-on will appear in the Add-ons list with its checkbox un-ticked. Tick it to enable the Add-on.
5. Twirl the arrow preceding the check-box to reveal some information and, most importantly, **the Add-on's Preferences**. Note that it asks for **the path of a "resources" folder**.

    Some of the Add-on's features depend on looking for information and game assets inside a SWTOR assets extraction (typically produced by apps such as SWTOR Slicers or EasyMYP). In the case of a SWTOR Slicers extraction, the "resources" folder is inside the folder set as that app's Output Folder.
    
    Click on the folder icon to produce a file browser dialog window where to locate the "resources" folder, or type or copy the folder path inside the filepath field.
        
The Add-on's tools will appear in the 3D Viewport's Sidebar ('n' key), in the "ZG SWTOR" tab.

The current tools are:

## SWTOR Materials Tools:

### Process Uber Materials:
Processes all the Uber-type materials detected in a selection of objects, locating their related texturemaps and linking them to a SWTOR Uber shader (modern or legacy, whichever are active). It processes any EmissiveOnly-type (glass) materials, too. It's particularly fast, as it (only) works with an asset extraction's "resources" folder.

Redo Panel options:
* **Overwrite Uber Materials** (off by default): overwrites already present Uber and EmissiveOnly objects's materials, which allows for regenerating materials that might have lost texturemaps, converting Uber materials from Legacy to modern and viceversa, etc. The option appears in the Undo box at the bottom-left side of the 3D Viewport.
* **Collect Collider Objects** (on by default): adds all objects with an "Util_collision_hidden" material to a Collection named "Collider Objects".

**It needs the presence of an enabled [SWTOR importer Add-on ("io_scene_gr2")](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x)** in Blender, either the latest version or the [**Legacy**](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/Granny2-Plug-In-Blender-2.8x/releases/tag/v.3.0) one, as it uses their Uber materials. In the case of the Legacy materials, importing any throwaway game object might be needed in order to generate the required material template if none are there.

This tool produces a simplistic glass material, Principled Shader-based, for EmissiveOnly-type materials such as those in spaceship windows, too.

As some sets of objects, such as spaceship interiors, can easily have a hundred materials or more, Blender might look like being unresponsive while processing them. Its progress can be followed in Blender's Console output, which will show the objects and materials being processed. Some error messages are prone to appear, due to some unintended interactions with the modern version of the SWTOR Importer Add-on: those are expected, and don't affect the final result.

### Deduplicate Scene's Nodegroups:
Consolidates all duplicates of a node in the scene ("node.001", "node.002", etc.) so that they become instances of the original instead of independent ones. The copies are marked as "zero users" so that, after saving the project, the next time it is opened they will be discarded (that's how Blender deals with such things).
* It acts on all the nodes of a scene, and doesn't require a selection of objects.

### Set Backface Culling On/Off:
It sets all the materials in the selected objects' Backface Culling setting to on or off (the setting is fully reversible). Many SWTOR objects, especially floors, walls, and ceilings of spaceships and some buildings, are single-sided by nature, which ought to make their sides facing away from the camera invisible. Blender, by default, renders single-sided objects as double-sided unless Backface Culling is enabled.
* It **doesn't** depend on the presence of a .gr2 importer add-on: this setting works in any kind of Blender material, no matter if SWTOR-based or any other kind.

The usefulness of this tool becomes apparent when having to deal with interior scenes such as spaceship rooms, where we have to place models (characters, furniture, props.) while having the walls and ceilings occluding our view. There are cumbersome solutions to that, such as hiding polygons, playing with the camera clipping settings or using a booleaning object to "eat" walls or ceilings away. This is simpler and faster. Also, it doesn't affect the rendering when placing the camera inside, as there the one-sided objects are facing the camera in the intended manner.

**Warning: if a selected object's material is shared with objects that haven't been selected (and that's very typical in architectural objects like spaceships or buildings), the effect will be visible in those objects, too.** This is normal, and maybe inconvenient. The only solution to this would be to isolate the material we don't want to be affected by changing its name. Still, for the intended use, it doesn't seem to be anything beyond a nuisance.

## SWTOR Objects Tools:

### Merge Double Vertices:
Merges "duplicate" vertices (applies a "Merge By Distance" with a tolerance of 0.000001 m.), which usually solves many issues when fusing body parts or applying Subdivision or Multiresolution Modifiers.
* Requires a selection of one or several game objects.
* When selecting multiple objects, the tool acts on each of them separately so as not to merge vertices of different objects by accident.
